I used ChatGPT to come up with this quick script to select possible colors for use in NGPC programming.  

Change the Red, Green and Blue values from 0-15 and see the results in the square.

The resulting values are a hex RGB value that can be used in standard image editors, and a representation of the RGB formula from the NGPC C framework that can be used directly in C code as needed.
